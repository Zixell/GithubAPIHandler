# GitHub API Handler

 The service where the user can enter any word and get the list of PHP and JavaScript repositories from GitHub where the entered word is mentioned in the name. Each repository in the list contains name, link to repository on GitHub and some information about repository owner.
 
Used technologies:
  - Spring MVC, Spring boot
  - Jackson

To run you need to import project:
- First of all clone repository or download it as zip
- If you downloaded project as zip then extract it to any directory
- Go to your IDE
- If you use Intellij Idea go File/Open.. then find directory with the project, click "pom.xml" and then click "Ok"
- Profit!

Pretty sure another IDEs have similar interface to do that.
